text-lang-ER is a DSL built using
[textX](https://github.com/igordejanovic/textX).  It is used for specification
of application's entity-relationship data model. From this description CRUDS
functionality can be generated fully automatically.

The language shall follow ideas from [this
paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.430.8620).

The plan is to develop not only grammar of the language but also app generators
for several platforms.
