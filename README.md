textX-ER is a DSL built using `textX`_.  It is used for specification of
application's entity-relationship data model. From this description
CRUDS functionality can be generated fully automatically.

The language shall follow ideas from `this paper`_.

The plan is to develop not only grammar of the language but also app generators
for several platforms.
